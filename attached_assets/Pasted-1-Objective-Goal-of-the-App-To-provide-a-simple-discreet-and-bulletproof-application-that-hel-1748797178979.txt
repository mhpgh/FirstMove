1. Objective / Goal of the App:To provide a simple, discreet, and "bulletproof" application that helps couples in committed relationships overcome hesitancy in initiating intimacy. The app facilitates tacit communication by allowing partners to signal their mood/desire for intimacy, only notifying both if there's a mutual, overlapping interest, thus reducing uncertainty and the fear of misreading signals.2. Target Audience:Adult couples in committed relationships who wish to improve or facilitate communication around intimacy.3. Platform:Mobile App (iOS & Android).For Replit AI: Consider a cross-platform framework like React Native, or a Progressive Web App (PWA) if native mobile generation is complex, ensuring push notification capabilities.4. Core MVP Features:4.1. User Authentication:* Users must sign up and log in exclusively using their Google credentials (OAuth 2.0).* No separate app-specific usernames or passwords.* The app will request minimal necessary profile information from Google (e.g., name for display, email for identification, profile picture URL for display to the paired partner).4.2. Partner Pairing:* A user (User A) initiates pairing with their partner (User B, who must also have an account).* Invitation Methods:* Email Invite: User A can trigger an email invite to User B. The app should generate a unique, time-limited pairing link or code, and this should be included in an email.* QR Code Invite: User A can display a QR code in their app. User B scans this QR code using their app to receive the pairing invitation. The QR code will contain a unique, time-limited pairing link/code.* Pairing invitations expire after 24 hours. Expired invitations can be resent.* User B must accept the invitation to complete the pairing.* Once paired, the app must clearly display the name and Google profile picture of the partner.* Unpairing: Either partner can choose to unpair at any time via a menu option in settings.* Upon unpairing, all data specific to that pairing (moods, shared history) is deleted from the servers.* The other partner is notified within their app that they have been unpaired.4.3. "In the Mood" Status Management:* Users can set their status to "In the Mood."* Duration Selection:* Users must specify a duration for their "In the Mood" status.* This can be achieved via a slider or input for a number of hours, or by selecting a specific cutoff time (e.g., "until 9:30 PM").* Durations/times should be selectable in 15-minute increments.* Maximum duration: 24 hours.* Users can cancel or modify their "In the Mood" status at any time before a mutual match occurs.* The user's own app screen must provide a clear visual indicator of their current status (e.g., "In the Mood until 10:00 PM," or "Not currently in the mood").* If a user's set duration expires before a mutual match, their "In the Mood" status automatically clears.4.4. Matching Logic & "It's time!" State:* A Match occurs if both paired partners have active "In the Mood" statuses and their specified time windows have any overlap.* The match is triggered as soon as the overlapping period begins.* Upon Match:* Both users immediately receive a push notification. The notification text should be: "It's time!" and should display their partner's Google profile picture.* The in-app status for both users changes from "In the Mood" to "It's time!".* Duration of "It's time!" State: This state remains active until:* The calculated shared overlapping time from their original mood settings naturally ends, OR* One partner clicks the "We Connected!" button (see 4.5), OR* One partner cancels their underlying mood (see 4.6).* If the "It's time!" state ends because the overlapping window expired naturally (and "We Connected!" was not pressed), both users' statuses revert to neutral, and no connection is logged.4.5. "We Connected!" Confirmation & History Logging:* When the app is in the "It's time!" state for both users, a "We Connected!" button becomes visible/active on their main status screen.* If either partner clicks the "We Connected!" button:* A connection event (e.g., date/time of confirmation) is logged in a simple, shared connection history accessible to both partners.* The "It's time!" status (and any underlying "In the Mood" flags) immediately clears for both users. They return to a neutral state, and the "We Connected!" button disappears.4.6. Cancellation Handling (During "It's time!"):* If one partner (Partner A) cancels their mood while both are in the "It's time!" state (i.e., after a match notification but before "We Connected!" is pressed):* Partner A's status in their app reverts to neutral.* No explicit push notification about this cancellation is sent to Partner B.* Partner B's app, upon its next data refresh or server check, will reflect that the "It's time!" status is no longer active. Their screen will revert to the neutral state, and the "We Connected!" button will disappear. (This is a "silent" update on Partner B's side to avoid a direct rejection notification).4.7. Settings Screen:* Option to Unpair from current partner.* Link to view FAQ.* Link to view Privacy Policy.* Access to standard OS notification preferences for the app (sound/vibration).4.8. Data Handling & Privacy:* All sensitive user data (moods, times, connection history, pairing status) must be encrypted both in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.* The application will explicitly state it does not sell user data.* Upon account deletion by a user, or unpairing (for couple-specific data), all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) related to that user/pairing must be permanently expunged from active databases.* Only fully anonymized, aggregated usage patterns (which cannot be re-identified to any individual or couple) may be retained solely for the purpose of app improvement and statistical analysis.5. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Guidelines:5.1. Overall Aesthetic:* Inviting, warm, modern, and discreet.* Clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate.* Avoid overly "sexy," "cutesy," or clich√© romantic themes. Focus on mature, respectful connection.5.2. Key Screens (Illustrative List):* Login/Sign Up Screen: Prominent "Sign in with Google" button.* Onboarding/Introductory Screens: Briefly explain the app's purpose, core functionality, and privacy commitments.* Pairing Screen:* Interface to send email invite or display QR code.* Interface to scan QR code or accept pending invite.* Clear display of paired partner's name and Google profile picture once paired.* Option to unpair.* Main Status Screen:* Displays current user status: Neutral (e.g., "Set your mood"), "In the Mood until [Time/Duration]", "It's time!".* Primary action button/interface to set/modify "In the Mood" status and duration.* "We Connected!" button (visible and active only during the "It's time!" state for both users).* Connection History Screen: A simple, chronological list of dates/times when "We Connected!" was confirmed.* Settings Screen: Access to unpairing, FAQ, Privacy Policy, notification settings links.* FAQ Screen: Pre-populated answers to likely user questions.5.3. App Icon:* Design: Two pencil-sketched hearts overlapping in the style of a Venn diagram.* Coloration: The overlapped (intersection) section of the hearts is shaded. The non-overlapping sections of the hearts are outlines only.6. Technical Stack Suggestions (For Replit Context):Frontend Framework: React Native (if targeting installable mobile apps directly from Replit templates) or a responsive web framework (React, Vue, Svelte for a PWA).Backend Language/Framework: Node.js (e.g., Express.js) or Python (e.g., Flask, Django).Database: PostgreSQL or a NoSQL option like Firebase Firestore (Firestore is beneficial for real-time client updates).Authentication: Firebase Authentication for seamless Google Sign-In integration.Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending notifications to mobile/PWA clients.Hosting/Deployment: Replit's native hosting capabilities.Edge Cases (from previous discussion to keep in mind):Internet connection required for status setting/syncing; warn if offline.Time zones: Reconcile times based on UTC on the server but display in users' local time zones on the client.7. Future (Post-MVP) Features (Not for initial build):* Optional SMS notifications as an alternative/backup.* Simple usage statistics/insights for the couple (opt-in).* Ability to signal different types or nuances of "moods."* A gentle "nudge" feature if no app activity or connection for a TBD period (opt-in).
