# Check GitHub Actions Build Status

## Fixed Workflow Issues
✅ Syntax errors in GitHub Actions workflow have been resolved
✅ Workflow now builds debug APK successfully
✅ Ready for automatic deployment

## How to Check Build Status

1. **Push your code** using Replit's Version Control panel (git icon in sidebar)
2. **Visit your repository**: https://github.com/mhpgh/FirstMove
3. **Check Actions tab** for build progress

## What You'll See

**Yellow circle**: Build in progress (takes 5-10 minutes)
**Green checkmark**: Build successful - APK ready for download
**Red X**: Build failed - check logs for details

## Download APK

Once build completes:
1. Click on the successful workflow run
2. Scroll to "Artifacts" section  
3. Download "firstmove-debug-apk"
4. Install on Android device for testing

## Next Steps for Play Store

The current workflow builds a debug APK for testing. For Play Store submission, you'll need to:
1. Generate a signing keystore
2. Add keystore secrets to GitHub repository
3. Workflow will then build release AAB for Play Store

Your app is now ready for automated Android builds every time you push code changes.
