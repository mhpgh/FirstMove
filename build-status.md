# Mobile App Server Connection Fix

## Issue Resolved
- Mobile app was showing blank white screen
- Problem: App trying to connect to localhost instead of live server
- Solution: Updated Capacitor config to use actual Replit server URL

## Changes Made
- Updated `capacitor.config.ts` with live server URL
- Synced configuration to Android project
- Ready for new build with server connectivity

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. Download new APK from GitHub Actions
3. Install updated version on phone
4. App should now load properly with full functionality
